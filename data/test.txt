" I 'm going forty .
Do you think that 's too slow ?
Absolutely not .
It 's nasty out there , and anybody who drives faster than forty on a night like this is crazy .

The land of the frozen north had four seasons -- Fishing Season , Duck Season , Deer Season , and Mud Season . This was the first Thursday in April and Lake Eden was having the worst Mud Season on record .
